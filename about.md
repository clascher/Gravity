My name is Clara Schwamm and I am a senior undergraduate student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in the School of Information and Library Science and the Germanic and Slavic Languages and Literatures Department.  I will also complete a minor in Mathematics.

I intend to complete certification in middle grades math education and school librarianship.

Some academic topics of interest are information access and, related, education equity, as well as incorporating social justice and inclusive language into math curricula.

The best way to reach me is by email: clasch@live.unc.edu
